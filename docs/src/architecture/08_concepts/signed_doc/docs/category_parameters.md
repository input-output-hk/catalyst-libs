# Category Parameters

## Description

Category Parameters define the parameter data required for the
system at the Category level.

Parameter Data includes things such as:

* Functional parameters
* Timeline data
* Branded Content and Copy

The content of the parameters is defined solely by the
Category Parameters Form Template.

This allows parameters to vary based on individual system
requirements over time.

Functional Parameters are mapped using the (TBD Functional Parameters Map).

The payload of a Category is controlled by its template.

```

<!-- markdownlint-enable max-one-sentence-per-line -->

### Validation

The Category Parameters Document *MUST* be linked through [`parameters`](../metadata.md#parameters) to
its Campaign Parameters Document.

## Metadata

### [`type`](../metadata.md#type)

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD033 -->
| Parameter | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Required | yes |
| Format | [Document Type](../metadata.md#document-type) |
| Type | 48c20109-362a-4d32-9bba-e0a9cf8b45be |
<!-- markdownlint-enable MD033 -->
The document TYPE.

#### [`type`](../metadata.md#type) Validation

**MUST** be a known document type.

### [`id`](../metadata.md#id)

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD033 -->
| Parameter | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Required | yes |
| Format | [Document Id](../metadata.md#document-id) |
<!-- markdownlint-enable MD033 -->
Document ID, created the first time the document is created.
This must be a properly created [UUIDv7][RFC9562-V7] which contains the
timestamp of when the document was created.

#### [`id`](../metadata.md#id) Validation

The document ID validation is performed based on timestamp thresholds:

* If `future_threshold` is configured,
the document [`id`](../metadata.md#id) cannot be too far in the future from the
current time.
* If `past_threshold` is configured, the document [`id`](../metadata.md#id) cannot be too far in the past from the
current time.

### [`ver`](../metadata.md#ver)

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD033 -->
| Parameter | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Required | yes |
| Format | [Document Ver](../metadata.md#document-ver) |
<!-- markdownlint-enable MD033 -->
The unique version of the document.
The first version of the document must set [`ver`](../metadata.md#ver) == [`id`](../metadata.md#id)

[`ver`](../metadata.md#ver) represents new versions of the same document as it changes over time.

#### [`ver`](../metadata.md#ver) Validation

1. The document version must always be >= the document ID.
2. IF [`ver`](../metadata.md#ver) does not == [`id`](../metadata.md#id)
  then a document with [`id`](../metadata.md#id) and [`ver`](../metadata.md#ver) being equal *MUST* exist.
3. When a document with the same [`id`](../metadata.md#id) already exists,
  the new document's [`ver`](../metadata.md#ver) must be greater than
  the latest known submitted version for that [`id`](../metadata.md#id).
4. When a document with the same [`id`](../metadata.md#id) already exists,
  the new document's [`type`](../metadata.md#type) must be the same as
  the latest known submitted document's [`type`](../metadata.md#type) for that [`id`](../metadata.md#id).

### [`template`](../metadata.md#template)

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD033 -->
| Parameter | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Required | yes |
| Format | [Document Reference](../metadata.md#document-reference) |
| Valid References | [Category Parameters Form Template](category_parameters_form_template.md) |
<!-- markdownlint-enable MD033 -->
Reference to the template used to create and/or validate this document.

#### [`template`](../metadata.md#template) Validation

In addition to the validation performed for [Document Reference](../metadata.md#document-reference) type fields,
The document payload is not valid if it does not validate completely against the referenced template.

### [`collaborators`](../metadata.md#collaborators)

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD033 -->
| Parameter | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Required | optional |
| Format | [Collaborators Reference List](../metadata.md#collaborators-reference-list) |
<!-- markdownlint-enable MD033 -->
A list of collaborators who may also publish updates to versions of this document.
This should include all parties who have not signed this document directly.

Every subsequent version can amend the collaborators list.
However, the initial Author can never be removed from being able to
publish a new version of the document.

#### [`collaborators`](../metadata.md#collaborators) Validation

This list does not imply these collaborators have consented to collaborate, only that the author/s
are permitting these potential collaborators to participate in the drafting and submission process.
How collaborators are counted on a final submission is determined by a parameter defined at the
Brand/Campaign/Category level (parameter name TBD).
Depending on that configuration:

* All listed collaborators may be required to submit a `final` Submission Action in addition
  to the author; **OR**
* Only collaborators who submit a `final` Submission Action for the referenced version are
  included as collaborators on that submission.

If the parameter is not present, default to the latter mode (only final-signing collaborators are
included).
In all modes a document is only considered final when the original author has submitted `final`.

In the event there are **MULTIPLE** [`collaborators`](../metadata.md#collaborators) listed, they **MUST** be sorted.

Sorting for each element of [`collaborators`](../metadata.md#collaborators) follows the same sort order as specified for Map Keys,
as defined by [CBOR Deterministic Encoding][CBOR-LFD-ENCODING] (4.3.2 Length-First Map Key Ordering).

### [`revocations`](../metadata.md#revocations)

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD033 -->
| Parameter | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Required | optional |
| Format | [Version Revocations](../metadata.md#version-revocations) |
<!-- markdownlint-enable MD033 -->
A document may include a list of any prior versions which are considered to be revoked.
Only the revocation list in the latest version of the document applies.
Revoked documents are flagged as no longer valid, and should not be displayed.
As a special case, if the revocations are set to `true` then all versions of the document
are revoked, including the latest document.

In this case, when the latest document is revoked, the payload may be `nil`.
Any older document that has [`revocations`](../metadata.md#revocations) set to `true` is always to be filtered
and its payload is to be assumed to be invalid.

This allows for an entire document and any/all published versions to be revoked.
A new version of the document that is published after this, may reinstate prior
document versions, by not listing them as revoked.
However, any document where revocations was set `true` can never be reinstated.

#### [`revocations`](../metadata.md#revocations) Validation

If the field is `true` the payload may be absent or invalid.
Such documents may never be submitted.

### [`parameters`](../metadata.md#parameters)

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD033 -->
| Parameter | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Required | yes |
| Format | [Document Reference](../metadata.md#document-reference) |
| Valid References | [Campaign Parameters](campaign_parameters.md) |
<!-- markdownlint-enable MD033 -->
A reference to the Parameters Document this document lies under.

#### [`parameters`](../metadata.md#parameters) Validation

In addition to the validation performed for [Document Reference](../metadata.md#document-reference) type fields:

* Any linked referenced document that includes a [`parameters`](../metadata.md#parameters) metadata must match the
[`parameters`](../metadata.md#parameters) of the referencing document,
or a parent of those [`parameters`](../metadata.md#parameters).

For example, a linked reference to [Contest Parameters](contest_parameters.md) is transitively a reference to
the Parameters document it references, and each parameters document they reference
until the `Brand` parameters document is reached.

The use case here is for Templates.
The profile template, or proposal templates could be defined at any of these
levels, and as long as they all refer to the same chain of parameters in the
hierarchy they are all valid.

## Payload

Category Parameters Document controlling the Category
within a Campaign.

Must be valid according to the schema contained within the
[Document Reference](../metadata.md#document-reference) from the [`template`](../metadata.md#template) metadata.

## Signers

The following Admin roles may sign documents of this type:

* Brand Admin

Updates are allowed by the original author and from the 'collaborators' metadata field
of the previous submitted document's version.
