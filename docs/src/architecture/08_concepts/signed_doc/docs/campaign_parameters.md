# Campaign Parameters

## Description

Campaign Parameters define the parameter data required for the
system at the Campaign level.

Parameter Data includes things such as:

* Functional parameters
* Timeline data
* Branded Content and Copy

The content of the parameters is defined solely by the
Campaign Parameters Form Template.

This allows parameters to vary based on individual system
requirements over time.

Functional Parameters are mapped using the (TBD Functional Parameters Map).

The payload of a Campaign is controlled by its template.

```

<!-- markdownlint-enable max-one-sentence-per-line -->

### Validation

The Campaign Parameters Document *MUST* be linked through [`parameters`](../metadata.md#parameters) to
its Brand Parameters Document.

## Metadata

### [`type`](../metadata.md#type)

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD033 -->
| Parameter | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Required | yes |
| Format | [Document Type](../metadata.md#document-type) |
| Type | 0110ea96-a555-47ce-8408-36efe6ed6f7c |
<!-- markdownlint-enable MD033 -->
The document TYPE.

#### [`type`](../metadata.md#type) Validation

**MUST** be a known document type.

### [`id`](../metadata.md#id)

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD033 -->
| Parameter | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Required | yes |
| Format | [Document Id](../metadata.md#document-id) |
<!-- markdownlint-enable MD033 -->
Document ID, created the first time the document is created.
This must be a properly created [UUIDv7][RFC9562-V7] which contains the
timestamp of when the document was created.

#### [`id`](../metadata.md#id) Validation

IF [`ver`](../metadata.md#ver) does not == [`id`](../metadata.md#id) then a document with
[`id`](../metadata.md#id) and [`ver`](../metadata.md#ver) being equal *MUST* exist.

### [`ver`](../metadata.md#ver)

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD033 -->
| Parameter | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Required | yes |
| Format | [Document Ver](../metadata.md#document-ver) |
<!-- markdownlint-enable MD033 -->
The unique version of the document.
The first version of the document must set [`ver`](../metadata.md#ver) == [`id`](../metadata.md#id)

[`ver`](../metadata.md#ver) represents new versions of the same document as it changes over time.

#### [`ver`](../metadata.md#ver) Validation

The document version must always be >= the document ID.

### [`template`](../metadata.md#template)

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD033 -->
| Parameter | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Required | yes |
| Format | [Document Reference](../metadata.md#document-reference) |
| Valid References | [Campaign Parameters Form Template](campaign_parameters_form_template.md) |
<!-- markdownlint-enable MD033 -->
Reference to the template used to create and/or validate this document.

#### [`template`](../metadata.md#template) Validation

In addition to the validation performed for [Document Reference](../metadata.md#document-reference) type fields,
The document payload is not valid if it does not validate completely against the referenced template.

### [`collaborators`](../metadata.md#collaborators)

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD033 -->
| Parameter | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Required | optional |
| Format | [Collaborators Reference List](../metadata.md#collaborators-reference-list) |
<!-- markdownlint-enable MD033 -->
A list of collaborators who may also publish updates to versions of this document.
This should include all parties who have not signed this document directly.

Every subsequent version can amend the collaborators list.
However, the initial Author can never be removed from being able to
publish a new version of the document.

#### [`collaborators`](../metadata.md#collaborators) Validation

This list does not imply these collaborators have consented to collaborate, only that the author/s
are permitting these potential collaborators to participate in the drafting and submission process.
However, any document submission referencing a proposal MUST be signed by all collaborators in
addition to the author.

### [`revocations`](../metadata.md#revocations)

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD033 -->
| Parameter | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Required | optional |
| Format | [Version Revocations](../metadata.md#version-revocations) |
<!-- markdownlint-enable MD033 -->
A document may include a list of any prior versions which are considered to be revoked.
Only the revocation list in the latest version of the document applies.
Revoked documents are flagged as no longer valid, and should not be displayed.
As a special case, if the revocations are set to `true` then all versions of the document
are revoked, including the latest document.

In this case, when the latest document is revoked, the payload may be empty.
Any older document that has [`revocations`](../metadata.md#revocations) set to `true` is always to be filtered
and its payload is to be assumed to be invalid.

This allows for an entire document and any/all published versions to be revoked.
A new version of the document that is published after this, may reinstate prior
document versions, by not listing them as revoked.
However, any document where revocations was set `true` can never be reinstated.

#### [`revocations`](../metadata.md#revocations) Validation

If the field is `true` the payload may be absent or invalid.
Such documents may never be submitted.

### [`parameters`](../metadata.md#parameters)

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD033 -->
| Parameter | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Required | yes |
| Format | [Document Reference](../metadata.md#document-reference) |
| Valid References | [Brand Parameters](brand_parameters.md) |
<!-- markdownlint-enable MD033 -->
A reference to the Parameters Document this document lies under.

#### [`parameters`](../metadata.md#parameters) Validation

In addition to the validation performed for [Document Reference](../metadata.md#document-reference) type fields:

* Any linked referenced document that includes a [`parameters`](../metadata.md#parameters) metadata must match the
[`parameters`](../metadata.md#parameters) of the referencing document,
or a parent of those [`parameters`](../metadata.md#parameters).

For example, a linked reference to [Contest Parameters](contest_parameters.md) is transitively a reference to
the Parameters document it references, and each parameters document they reference
until the `Brand` parameters document is reached.

The use case here is for Templates.
The profile template, or proposal templates could be defined at any of these
levels, and as long as they all refer to the same chain of parameters in the
hierarchy they are all valid.

## Payload

Campaign Parameters Document controlling the Campaign
within a Brand.

Must be valid according to the schema contained within the
[Document Reference](../metadata.md#document-reference) from the [`template`](../metadata.md#template) metadata.

## Signers

The following Admin roles may sign documents of this type:

* Brand Admin

New versions of this document may be published by:

* author
* collaborators
