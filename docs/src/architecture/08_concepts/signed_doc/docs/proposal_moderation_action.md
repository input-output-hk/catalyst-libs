## [COSE Header Parameters][RFC9052-HeaderParameters]

* [content type](../spec.md#content-type) = `application/json`
* [content-encoding](../spec.md#content-encoding) = `[br]`

## Metadata

### [`type`](../metadata.md#type)

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD033 -->
| Parameter | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Required | yes |
| Format | [Document Type](../metadata.md#document-type) |
| Type | a552451a-8e5b-409d-83a0-21eac26bbf8c |
<!-- markdownlint-enable MD033 -->
The document TYPE.

#### [`type`](../metadata.md#type) Validation

**MUST** be a known document type.

### [`id`](../metadata.md#id)

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD033 -->
| Parameter | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Required | yes |
| Format | [Document Id](../metadata.md#document-id) |
<!-- markdownlint-enable MD033 -->
Document ID, created the first time the document is created.
This must be a properly created [UUIDv7][RFC9562-V7] which contains the
timestamp of when the document was created.

#### [`id`](../metadata.md#id) Validation

IF [`ver`](../metadata.md#ver) does not == [`id`](../metadata.md#id) then a document with
[`id`](../metadata.md#id) and [`ver`](../metadata.md#ver) being equal *MUST* exist.

### [`ver`](../metadata.md#ver)

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD033 -->
| Parameter | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Required | yes |
| Format | [Document Ver](../metadata.md#document-ver) |
<!-- markdownlint-enable MD033 -->
The unique version of the document.
The first version of the document must set [`ver`](../metadata.md#ver) == [`id`](../metadata.md#id)

[`ver`](../metadata.md#ver) represents new versions of the same document as it changes over time.

#### [`ver`](../metadata.md#ver) Validation

The document version must always be >= the document ID.

### [`ref`](../metadata.md#ref)

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD033 -->
| Parameter | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Required | yes |
| Format | [Document Reference](../metadata.md#document-reference) |
| Valid References | [Proposal](proposal.md) |
<!-- markdownlint-enable MD033 -->
Reference to a Linked Document or Documents.
This is the primary hierarchical reference to a related document.

If a reference is defined as required, there must be at least 1 reference specified.
Some documents allow multiple references, and they are documented as required.

The document reference serves two purposes:

1. It ensures that the document referenced by an ID/Version is not substituted.
    In other words, that the document intended to be referenced, is actually referenced.
2. It Allows the document to be unambiguously located in decentralized storage systems.

There can be any number of Document Locations in any reference.
The currently defined locations are:

* `cid` : A [CBOR Encoded IPLD Content Identifier][CBOR-TAG-42] ( AKA an [IPFS CID][IPFS-CID] ).
* Others may be added when further storage mechanisms are defined.

The document location does not guarantee that the document is actually stored.
It only defines that if it were stored, this is the identifier
that is required to retrieve it.
Therefore it is required that Document References
are unique and reproducible, given a documents contents.

#### [`ref`](../metadata.md#ref) Validation

The following must be true for a valid reference:

* The Referenced Document **MUST** Exist
* Every value in the `document_locator` must consistently reference the exact same document.
* The `document_id` and `document_ver` **MUST** match the values in the referenced document.
