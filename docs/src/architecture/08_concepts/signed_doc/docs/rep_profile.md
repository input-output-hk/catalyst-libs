# Rep Profile

## Description

A Rep Profile allows a representative voter to publish information
about themselves to help explain who they are and why someone should
consider delegating to them.

It is an extension of all other profiles attached to the same Catalyst ID.

Profiles themselves are intentionally general, however they may be
linked to a brand via the template used by the profile.

The payload of a profile is controlled by its template.

```graphviz dot rep_profile.dot.svg

```

<!-- markdownlint-enable max-one-sentence-per-line -->

### Validation

* The signer MUST be a registered 'Representative'.
* The payload MUST be valid against the [JSON schema][JSON Schema-2020-12] defined in the referenced
'Rep Profile Template'.

### Business Logic

#### Front End

* Display and allow editing of the Representative's core profile fields.
* This profile serves as the central hub for a Representative's public identity.

#### Back End

* Validate Representative profile data against the referenced 'Rep Profile Template' and store/index it.
* This global profile is the foundational document referenced by all of the Rep's contest specific profiles.

## [COSE Header Parameters][RFC9052-HeaderParameters]

* [content type](../spec.md#content-type) = `application/json`
* [content-encoding](../spec.md#content-encoding) = `[br]`

## Metadata

### [`type`](../metadata.md#type)

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD033 -->
| Parameter | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Required | yes |
| Format | [Document Type](../metadata.md#document-type) |
| Type | 0f2c86a2-ffda-40b0-ad38-23709e1c10b3 |
<!-- markdownlint-enable MD033 -->
The document TYPE.

#### [`type`](../metadata.md#type) Validation

**MUST** be a known document type.

### [`id`](../metadata.md#id)

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD033 -->
| Parameter | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Required | yes |
| Format | [Document Id](../metadata.md#document-id) |
<!-- markdownlint-enable MD033 -->
Document ID, created the first time the document is created.
This must be a properly created [UUIDv7][RFC9562-V7] which contains the
timestamp of when the document was created.

#### [`id`](../metadata.md#id) Validation

The document ID validation is performed based on timestamp thresholds:

* If `future_threshold` is configured,
the document [`id`](../metadata.md#id) cannot be too far in the future from the
current time.
* If `past_threshold` is configured, the document [`id`](../metadata.md#id) cannot be too far in the past from the
current time.

### [`ver`](../metadata.md#ver)

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD033 -->
| Parameter | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Required | yes |
| Format | [Document Ver](../metadata.md#document-ver) |
<!-- markdownlint-enable MD033 -->
The unique version of the document.
The first version of the document must set [`ver`](../metadata.md#ver) == [`id`](../metadata.md#id)

[`ver`](../metadata.md#ver) represents new versions of the same document as it changes over time.

#### [`ver`](../metadata.md#ver) Validation

1. The document version must always be >= the document ID.
2. IF [`ver`](../metadata.md#ver) does not == [`id`](../metadata.md#id)
  then a document with [`id`](../metadata.md#id) and [`ver`](../metadata.md#ver) being equal *MUST* exist.
3. When a document with the same [`id`](../metadata.md#id) already exists,
  the new document's [`ver`](../metadata.md#ver) must be greater than
  the latest known submitted version for that [`id`](../metadata.md#id).
4. When a document with the same [`id`](../metadata.md#id) already exists,
  the new document's [`type`](../metadata.md#type) must be the same as
  the latest known submitted document's [`type`](../metadata.md#type) for that [`id`](../metadata.md#id).

### [`template`](../metadata.md#template)

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD033 -->
| Parameter | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Required | yes |
| Format | [Document Reference](../metadata.md#document-reference) |
| Valid References | [Rep Profile Form Template](rep_profile_form_template.md) |
<!-- markdownlint-enable MD033 -->
Reference to the template used to create and/or validate this document.

#### [`template`](../metadata.md#template) Validation

In addition to the validation performed for [Document Reference](../metadata.md#document-reference) type fields,
The document payload is not valid if it does not validate completely against the referenced template.

### [`revocations`](../metadata.md#revocations)

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD033 -->
| Parameter | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Required | optional |
| Format | [Version Revocations](../metadata.md#version-revocations) |
<!-- markdownlint-enable MD033 -->
A document may include a list of any prior versions which are considered to be revoked.
Only the revocation list in the latest version of the document applies.
Revoked documents are flagged as no longer valid, and should not be displayed.
As a special case, if the revocations are set to `true` then all versions of the document
are revoked, including the latest document.

In this case, when the latest document is revoked, the payload may be `nil`.
Any older document that has [`revocations`](../metadata.md#revocations) set to `true` is always to be filtered
and its payload is to be assumed to be invalid.

This allows for an entire document and any/all published versions to be revoked.
A new version of the document that is published after this, may reinstate prior
document versions, by not listing them as revoked.
However, any document where revocations was set `true` can never be reinstated.

#### [`revocations`](../metadata.md#revocations) Validation

If the field is `true` the payload may be absent or invalid.
Such documents may never be submitted.

### [`parameters`](../metadata.md#parameters)

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD033 -->
| Parameter | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Required | yes |
| Format | [Document Reference](../metadata.md#document-reference) |
| Valid References | [Brand Parameters](brand_parameters.md) |
| Linked Reference Metadata | [`template`](#template) |
<!-- markdownlint-enable MD033 -->
A reference to the Parameters Document this document lies under.

#### [`parameters`](../metadata.md#parameters) Validation

In addition to the validation performed for [Document Reference](../metadata.md#document-reference) type fields:

* Any linked referenced document that includes a [`parameters`](../metadata.md#parameters) metadata must match the
[`parameters`](../metadata.md#parameters) of the referencing document,
or a parent of those [`parameters`](../metadata.md#parameters).

For example, a linked reference to [Contest Parameters](contest_parameters.md) is transitively a reference to
the Parameters document it references, and each parameters document they reference
until the `Brand` parameters document is reached.

The use case here is for Templates.
The profile template, or proposal templates could be defined at any of these
levels, and as long as they all refer to the same chain of parameters in the
hierarchy they are all valid.

* The Document referenced by [`template`](../metadata.md#template)
    * MUST contain [`parameters`](../metadata.md#parameters) metadata; AND
    * MUST match the referencing documents [`parameters`](../metadata.md#parameters) value.

## Payload

The Representative profile payload contains all Representative-specific fields.
Its structure is defined by the referenced Rep Profile Template.

Must be valid according to the schema contained within the
[Document Reference](../metadata.md#document-reference) from the [`template`](../metadata.md#template) metadata.

## Signers

The following User roles may sign documents of this type:

* Representative

Only the original author can update and sign a new version of documents.
