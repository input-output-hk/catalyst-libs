## Abstract

This document describes a Catalyst V2 vote transaction structure.

## Motivation

## Specification

Catalyst v2 voting transaction is a [Catalyst Signed Document],
so its fully follows the structure of the [Catalyst Signed Document] specification.

### Metadata Fields

A list of used [Catalyst Signed Document protected header fields](./../signed_doc/spec.md#signed-object-fields).

```CDDL
"brand_id" => UUID, ; UUID v4
"campaign_id" => UUID, ; UUID v4
"election_id" => UUID, ; UUID v4
"category_id" => UUID, ; UUID v4
```

* `brand_id` - a unique identifier which represents a "brand" who is running the voting,
    e.g. Catalyst, Midnight.
* `campaign_id` - a unique identifier which defines a "campaign" of voting,
    e.g. "treasury campaign".
* `election_id` - a unique identifier which defines an election,
    e.g. "Catalyst Fund 1", "Catalyst Fund 2".
* `category_id` - a unique identifier which defines a voting category as a collection of proposals,
    e.g. "Development & Infrastructure", "Products & Integrations".

* [`content type`](./../signed_doc/spec.md#content-type): `application/cbor`.
  [Catalyst Signed Document content] must be a [CBOR] encoded.

  ```CDDL
  3 => 50
  ```

* [`content encoding`](./../signed_doc/spec.md#content-encoding-optional):
  [Catalyst Signed Document content] must be [Brotli] compressed.

  ```CDDL
  "content-type" => "br"
  ```

#### Public vote

For the public vote [`type`](./../signed_doc/spec.md#type) value defined as follows:

* [`type`](./../signed_doc/spec.md#type): `8de5586c-e998-4b95-8742-7be3c8592803` [UUID] value.

  ```CDDL
  "type" => 37(h'8DE5586CE9984B9587427BE3C8592803')
  ```

##### Content format

The public vote transaction [Catalyst Signed Document content] format is based on the [Generalized Vote Transaction Structure].

Following that spec need to define a `choice`, `proof` and `prop-id`.

<!-- markdownlint-disable max-one-sentence-per-line code-block-style -->
??? note "Public vote transaction v2 definition: `vote_tx_v2_public.cddl`"

    ```CDDL
    {{ include_file('src/architecture/08_concepts/catalyst_voting/cddl/vote_tx_v2_public.cddl', indent=4) }}
    ```
<!-- markdownlint-enable max-one-sentence-per-line code-block-style -->

#### Private vote

For the private vote [`type`](./../signed_doc/spec.md#type) value defined as follows:

* [`type`](./../signed_doc/spec.md#type): `e78ee18d-f380-44c1-a852-80aa6ecb07fe` [UUID] value.

  ```CDDL
  "type" => 37(h'E78EE18DF38044C1A85280AA6ECB07FE')
  ```

##### Content format

The private vote transaction [Catalyst Signed Document content] format is based on the [Generalized Vote Transaction Structure].

Following that spec need to define a `choice`, `proof` and `prop-id`.

<!-- markdownlint-disable max-one-sentence-per-line code-block-style -->
??? note "Private vote transaction v2 definition: `vote_tx_v2_private.cddl`"

    ```CDDL
    {{ include_file('src/architecture/08_concepts/catalyst_voting/cddl/vote_tx_v2_private.cddl', indent=4) }}
    ```
<!-- markdownlint-enable max-one-sentence-per-line code-block-style -->

##### Vote and Proof generation

To generate a cryptographically secured `choice-data` and `zk_proof` parts you can follow this [spec](./crypto.md#vote).
Important to note,
that as part of [*initial setup*](./crypto.md#initial-setup) of the voting procedure,
the following properties are used:

1. Each proposal, defined by the `proposal` field, defines a number of possible options.
2. [ristretto255] as a backend cryptographic group.
3. A commitment key $ck$ defined as a [BLAKE2b-512] hash of the `proposal` bytes.

## Rationale

## Path to Active

### Acceptance Criteria
<!-- Describes what are the acceptance criteria whereby a proposal becomes 'Active' -->

### Implementation Plan
<!-- A plan to meet those criteria or `N/A` if an implementation plan is not applicable. -->
