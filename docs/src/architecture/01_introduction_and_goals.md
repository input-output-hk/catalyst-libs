# Introduction and Goals

<!-- See: https://docs.arc42.org/section-1/ -->

## Requirements Overview

Catalyst-libs is a monorepo providing reusable libraries for the Catalyst ecosystem. It contains:

- **Rust Crates**: 18 reusable crates for Cardano blockchain integration, signed documents, voting, RBAC, and data processing
- **Flutter/Dart Packages**: Cross-platform mobile and web libraries
- **Python Packages**: FFI bindings for Python integration

### Functional Requirements

1. **Blockchain Integration**
   - Read and follow Cardano blockchain updates
   - Support for mainnet, preprod, and preview networks
   - Mithril snapshot support for efficient synchronization
   - Support for Cardano protocol types and transactions

2. **Signed Documents**
   - Create, sign, and verify Catalyst signed documents
   - Support for COSE (CBOR Object Signing and Encryption) format
   - Document versioning and collaboration
   - Multiple document types (proposals, ballots, comments, etc.)

3. **Voting Support**
   - Vote transaction creation (v1 and v2 formats)
   - Contest and ballot management
   - Voting protocol implementation

4. **RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)**
   - RBAC registration on Cardano blockchain
   - Catalyst ID URI specification
   - Key derivation and management
   - C509 certificate support

5. **Data Processing**
   - CBOR encoding/decoding (cbork family)
   - IPFS integration (hermes-ipfs)
   - Immutable ledger operations

6. **Cross-Platform Support**
   - Rust crates usable from Rust, WebAssembly, and via FFI
   - Flutter/Dart packages for mobile and web
   - Python bindings for Python applications

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **Reusability**: Libraries must be usable independently or together
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive API documentation with examples
- **Testing**: High test coverage with integration tests
- **Performance**: Efficient resource usage for blockchain operations
- **Security**: Secure handling of cryptographic keys and signatures
- **Compatibility**: Support for multiple Cardano protocol versions

## Quality Goals

Main quality goals:

|  Quality Category |  Quality   |  Description |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| Usable |  User experience  | The libraries should offer an intuitive and easy-to-navigate interface |
| Usable  | Correctness  |The functionality provided by the libraries should deliver accurate and expected results |
| Secure   | Access control  | Role-Based Access Control  |
| Secure   | Privacy  | User information are kept private  |
| Secure   | Accountability  |  Actions and results generated by the libraries should be traceable and auditable by authorized parties |
| Reliable   |  Fail-safe | In case of failures, the libraries should be designed to prevent data loss and ensure system stability |
| Maintainable | Code Quality | Code follows strict linting rules, comprehensive documentation, and clear structure |
| Performant | Efficiency | Efficient resource usage, especially for blockchain synchronization and cryptographic operations |
