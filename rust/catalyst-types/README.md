# Catalyst Types

This library is designed to streamline the organization and sharing of types across multiple crates.
It provides a centralized location for reusable, enhanced types that are not specific to a particular domain, such as Cardano.

## Purpose

* To enhance types that can be utilized across different libraries or projects.
* To provide utility functions related to types and conversion between types.
