Your First Code Contribution Improving The Documentation Style guides Rust Dart Flutter Commit Messages All types of contributions are encouraged and valued. Please make sure to read the relevant section before making your contribution. It will make it a lot easier for us maintainers and smooth out the experience for all involved. The community looks forward to your contributions. \ud83c\udf89 Code of Conduct \u00b6 This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the catalyst-libs Code of Conduct . By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to code-of-conduct@iohk.io . I Have a Question \u00b6 If you want to ask a question, we assume that you have read the available Documentation . Before you ask a question, it is best to search for existing Issues that might help you. In case you have found a suitable issue and still need clarification, you can write your question here . It is also advisable to search the internet for answers first. If you then still feel the need to ask a question and need clarification, we recommend the following: Open an Issue . Provide as much context as you can about what you're running into. Provide project and platform versions ( rustc --version --verbose , flutter doctor -v , etc), depending on what seems relevant. We will then take care of the issue as soon as possible. I Want To Contribute \u00b6 Reporting Bugs \u00b6 Before Submitting a Bug Report \u00b6 A good bug report shouldn't leave others needing to chase you up for more information. Therefore, we ask you to investigate carefully, collect information and describe the issue in detail in your report. Please complete the following steps in advance to help us fix any potential bug as fast as possible. Make sure that you are using the latest version. Determine if your bug is really a bug and not an error on your side. e.g. using incompatible environment components/versions (Make sure that you have read the documentation . If you are looking for support, you might want to check this section . To see if other users have experienced (and potentially already solved) the same issue you are having. Check if there is not already a bug report existing for your bug or error in the bug tracker . Also make sure to search the internet (including Stack Overflow) to see if users outside the GitHub community have discussed the issue. Collect information about the bug: Stack trace (Traceback) OS, Platform and Version (Windows, Linux, macOS, x86, ARM) Version of the interpreter, compiler, SDK, runtime environment, package manager, depending on what seems relevant. Possibly your input and the output Can you reliably reproduce the issue? And can you also reproduce it with older versions? How Do I Submit a Good Bug Report? \u00b6 You must never report security related issues, vulnerabilities or bugs including sensitive information to the issue tracker, or elsewhere in public. Instead sensitive bugs must be sent by email to security@iohk.io . We use GitHub issues to track bugs and errors. If you run into an issue with the project: Open an Issue . (Since we can't be sure at this point whether it is a bug or not, we ask you not to talk about a bug yet and not to label the issue.) Explain the behavior you would expect and the actual behavior. Please provide as much context as possible. Describe the reproduction steps that someone else can follow to recreate the issue on their own. This usually includes your code. For good bug reports you should isolate the problem and create a reduced test case. Provide the information you collected in the previous section. Once it's filed: The project team will label the issue accordingly. A team member will try to reproduce the issue with your provided steps. If there are no reproduction steps or no obvious way to reproduce the issue, the team will ask you for those steps. The issue would then be marked as needs-repro . Bugs with the needs-repro tag will not be addressed until they are reproduced. If the team is able to reproduce the issue, it will be marked bug . It may possibly be marked with other tags (such as critical ). The issue will then be left to be implemented by someone . Suggesting Enhancements \u00b6 This section guides you through submitting an enhancement suggestion for catalyst-libs, including completely new features and minor improvements to existing functionality . Following these guidelines will help maintainers and the community to understand your suggestion and find related suggestions. Before Submitting an Enhancement \u00b6 Make sure that you are using the latest version. Read the documentation carefully. Find out if the functionality is already covered, maybe by an individual configuration. Perform a search to see if the enhancement has already been suggested. If it has, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one. Find out whether your idea fits with the scope and aims of the project. It's up to you to make a strong case to convince the project's developers of the merits of this feature. Keep in mind that we want features that will be useful to the majority of our users and not just a small subset. If you're just targeting a minority of users, consider writing an add-on/plugin library. How Do I Submit a Good Enhancement Suggestion? \u00b6 Enhancement suggestions are tracked as GitHub issues . Use a clear and descriptive title for the issue to identify the suggestion. Provide a step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement in as many details as possible. Describe the current behavior and explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why. At this point you can also tell which alternatives do not work for you. You may want to include screenshots and animated GIFs . This can help you demonstrate the steps or point out the part which the suggestion is related to. You can use this tool to record GIFs on macOS and Windows, and this tool or this tool on Linux. Explain why this enhancement would be useful to most catalyst-libs users. You may also want to point out the other projects that solved it better and which could serve as inspiration. Your First Code Contribution \u00b6 Embarking on your first code contribution can be an exhilarating yet intimidating endeavor. Here at catalyst-libs, we foster a welcoming and supportive environment to ensure that everyone can contribute to the codebase irrespective of their experience level. Below is a step-by-step guide to making your first code contribution to our repository: Set Up Your Environment : Fork the repository to your GitHub account. Clone your fork locally on your machine. Set up the development environment following the instructions in the README. Pick an Issue : Browse through the open issues in the GitHub repository. Pick an issue that interests you and aligns with your skills. Beginners might look for issues tagged as good first issue or beginner-friendly . Understand the Issue : Thoroughly read through the issue to understand the problem. Ask clarifying questions in the issue thread if necessary. Branch Out : Create a new branch on your local machine to work on the issue. It's a good practice to name your branch descriptively, e.g., fix-button-bug. Work on the Issue : Work on the issue in your local development environment. Adhere to the coding standards and guidelines provided in the Style guides section. Test Your Changes : Ensure that your changes are well-tested. Verify that your changes don't break any existing functionality. Commit Your Changes : Write a clear and concise commit message following the Style guides -> Commit Messages section guidelines. Push Your Changes : Push your changes to your fork on GitHub. Open a Pull Request : Open a pull request from your fork to the main repository. Provide a detailed description of your changes, the issue it addresses, and any additional information that might help maintainers review your contribution. Review and Revision : Respond to any feedback from the maintainers. Make necessary revisions to your code. Merge and Celebrate : Once your pull request is approved, it will be merged into the main codebase. Celebrate your contribution and share it with the community! Remember, every contributor was new at some point, and we are thrilled to welcome new members to our community. The journey of becoming an adept open-source contributor is rewarding and educational. Your contribution, no matter how small, can make a significant impact. Happy coding! Improving The Documentation \u00b6 Documentation is a cornerstone of any successful open-source project. It aids developers in understanding the purpose, structure, and functioning of the code, making the project accessible to all, irrespective of their level of expertise. Our project thrives on the contributions from the community, and improving the documentation is one of the significant ways you can contribute. Here are some ways you could help improve our documentation: Clarification : If you find any ambiguous or unclear documentation, feel free to clarify the wording or suggest improvements through a pull request. Expansion : If areas of the documentation are lacking in detail or missing altogether, contributing expanded explanations or new sections is highly encouraged. Correction : Spot a mistake? Whether it's a spelling error, grammatical error, or incorrect information, your corrections are welcome. Examples : Adding examples to the documentation can significantly enhance utility. If you have examples that illustrate the use of our code, we'd love to include them. Consistency : Ensure the documentation maintains a consistent style and tone. Adhering to the style guidelines specified in our Style guides section is crucial. Technical Accuracy : Ensure that the documentation reflects the current state of the codebase and is technically accurate. Your contributions should follow the guidelines specified in our Style guides section to maintain high quality and consistency. Before making a substantial change, it's a good practice to open an issue to discuss the proposed changes or find an existing issue to work on. Together, we can ensure that our documentation is a valuable resource for all new and experienced developers. Style guides \u00b6 Rust \u00b6 For Rust, we follow the Rust Style Guide . Dart \u00b6 For Dart, we follow the Effective Dart style guide. Flutter \u00b6 For Flutter, we follow the Flutter Style Guide . Commit Messages \u00b6 Clear and consistent commit messages are crucial for maintaining a readable history in our collaborative environment. Adhering to a structured commit message format also enables us to generate changelogs and navigate through the project's history more efficiently. We follow the Conventional Commits standard for all commit messages in this repository. Here's a brief overview of the Conventional Commits standard: Type : The type of change being made (e.g., feat, fix, chore, docs, style, refactor, perf, test). Scope (Optional) : The scope of the change, denoting what part of the codebase is being altered. Description : A short, descriptive message of the change, written in the imperative mood. Format: <type>(<scope>): <description> Example: feat(button): add a 'submit' button to form component fix(modal): resolve issue with modal overlay not closing chore(tests): update unit tests for utilities module Breaking Changes : If your commit introduces a breaking change, it should be flagged with a ! after the type. Include BREAKING CHANGE: in the body or footer of the commit message to describe what changed and its implications. Example: feat!(dropdown): change the behavior of dropdown component BREAKING CHANGE: alters dropdown trigger to be activated on hover instead of on click. Footer (Optional) : Any additional metadata regarding your commit, such as related issue trackers or BREAKING CHANGE annotations. Following this format makes the version control history readable and reflects professionalism and foresight in maintaining a clean, well-documented codebase.","title":"Contributing"},{"location":"appendix/important/contributing/#contributing-to-catalyst-libs","text":"First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! \u2764\ufe0f Contributing to Catalyst Libs Code of Conduct I Have a Question I Want To Contribute Reporting Bugs Before Submitting a Bug Report How Do I Submit a Good Bug Report?

We will often be syncing from TIP or Genesis, and after synchronization we will be syncing from Tip eventually. A node follower is a reasonably heavy process, and every connection to a relay node also adds load to the relay node itself. It is not efficient or necessary to have multiple followers syncing from the same point as the data stream is identical. Pool of Node followers \u00b6 We will maintain a Pool of active node followers. When a wasm module in an application subscribes to a Node followers data stream, IF there is a pre-existing node follower which can serve its needs, then it should simply receive the events from that stream. It will not create a new stream for every subscription. When the last subscriber to a Node followers connection/stream unsubscribes, it will stop the connection. This means that there is not one follower per application, there is one follower per stream type. For example, if a wasm module subscribes to a stream of events from Genesis, and Tip, it will have two active streams. If a second application also subscribes to Genesis, it can retrieve the same events and there is no need to start a third follower. Implementation details \u00b6 Application modules can subscribe to events from Tip, Genesis OR a particular block within the block chain. There are a number of considerations which should be handled to make stream selection efficient. There is also a case where a stream is requested to \"continue\" and it needs special handling to be efficient. Maximizing the number of listeners to an event stream \u00b6 We want to maximize the number of listeners to individual event streams. This will improve efficiency overall. If two applications both request a stream of blocks from mainnet, from Genesis. Then ideally they both listen to the same stream. However, both applications can start asynchronously, and there is no guarantee when each application or module will subscribe to the stream. This can cause the following situation (These event all happen in rapid succession in this example): App 1 subscribes to genesis. Connection to Node occurs, and block 1 is received, and sent to App 1. App 2 subscribes to genesis. The first connection can not be used because we are already past genesis on that stream, so we need to create a second stream. The problem here is we have two streams, but they are only 1 block apart. Further, based on timing it may be that either exceeds the other depending on how fast their individual connection to the relay is. This is not ideal. There are a number of ways this can be solved. Use a block cache for recent blocks, so that subscriptions that are close in time can use the same stream by re-using blocks from the cache. Delay when we connect a stream to allow for the maximum number of subscribers. Optimizing the streams on the fly. For example if 2 streams are at different points, but they could catch up and become equal. the moment they become equal one of the streams is closed and all block data is now taken from a single stream. This is likely to occur, for example a follower from Tip and Genesis. Once the Genesis follower has reached tip we now have two followers from Tip when only 1 is required. An ideal solution may need multiple techniques. Note: There may be other techniques and these are just some obvious solutions to the issue. For the initial implementation of the Follower, we will employ technique 2 and a limited version of Technique 3 ONLY. Delaying starting of the streams \u00b6 When a stream is subscribed, and it results in a new stream, then the connection to that relay node will not happen for 5 seconds. Any further subscriptions to the same stream can then be added to the pending connection. Once the connection is made, then further subscriptions will only be added to it if they are valid for that connection. Otherwise a second connection is established, again with its own 5 second start delay. This delay occurs regardless of where the stream is to start from Tip, Genesis or a particular block. Optimizing the streams \u00b6 If we have two followers for a particular network, and they are BOTH on TIP, then one is stopped and all subscribers for it are moved to the other. This needs to check that not only are they both reported to be on TIP, but that the TIPs are identical. We do not need to do any other stream optimization at this time. The purpose of this is to ensure that once followers have fully synced we are not running excessive followers that are doing the same work and reporting the same events. Handling \"Continue\" connections \u00b6 There is an option to listen to a stream from \"Continue\" but what does \"Continue\" actually mean? If there are multiple streams it could match on, which one does it match? We will use the rule that if \"Continue\" is specified, it means \"Follow the blockchain with the earliest blocks\". So if there are three followers, one from Genesis, one from block 10,000 and one from Tip. \"Continue\" will join the Genesis follower. There is a further condition for \"Continue\" which is what happens if \"Continue\" is specified but there are no blockchain followers running or pending for the same Application? This can only happen either at the start of world for a particular Application OR an Application has unsubscribed from all blockchain events. In this case the \"Continue\" subscription should be added to list of continue subscriptions for each application. When a block is received and about to be sent as an event to an application, we can check the \"Continue\" list for that app, If there are subscriptions in that list, and the event is from the oldest active follower for the app then they are removed from that list, and added as active subscriptions to the selected follower. Then all subscribed modules in the app (including any recently added from the continue list) are sent the event. Further Optimizations \u00b6 The initial set of connection optimizations are detailed here. Further connection optimization work will only be conducted after these are implemented and the characteristics of the followers running in a Hermes environment are better understood.","title":"Cardano Chain Follower Instances"},{"location":"architecture/08_concepts/cardano_chain_follower/follower_instances/#cardano-chain-follower-instances","text":"This document details how the individual chain follower instances are organized within the Hermes runtime extension.","title":"Cardano Chain Follower Instances"},{"location":"architecture/08_concepts/cardano_chain_follower/follower_instances/#basic-principles","text":"There are 3 primary cardano networks, Mainnet, Preprod and Preview.

Overview \u00b6 The cardano-chain-follower crate provides functionality to read arbitrary blocks and follow updates (new blocks and rollbacks) from a Cardano network (e.g. mainnet, preprod). Currently, the all communication with a Cardano node (remote or local) is done using the Node-to-Node protocol . A Mithril snapshot can be configured to be used both when reading blocks and following chain updates. The Pallas crate is used under the hood to provide node communication, block parsing and other Cardano chain features. 1.1 Chain Follow \u00b6 The chain follower is capable of receiving chain updates from a Cardano node using the ChainSync miniprotocol. Read pointer \u00b6 The read pointer points at the location the chain is being read by a client connection. Chain Updates \u00b6 The chain follower spawns a background task that keeps a Node-to-Node connection to a Cardano node and continuously receives updates from it and sends them to the follower using a async channel. A chain update can be either a roll forward (a new block added to the chain) or a rollback. If any node communication error happens in the background task, this is also sent through the channel. If the follower has been configured to use a Mithril snapshot, it will generate synthetic roll forward chain updates for each block until the snapshot's tip is reached. After that, updates are received from the node. If any errors occur while reading the block from the Mithril snapshot (e.g. the block is missing from the snapshot, I/O errors) the background task will fallback to receiving the failed block from the Cardano node. Below is a simplified flow diagram of the background task's process for producing chain updates. A. Chain update flow diagram \u00b6 1.2 Chain Read \u00b6 NOTE: Reading blocks does not affect the follower read pointer. When reading a single or a range of arbitrary blocks from the chain the follower initiates a new connection with the configured node blocks are read using the Blockfetch miniprotocol. If configured, available blocks are read from the Mithril snapshot as well. When a block is requested, the follower will try reading the block from the Mithril snapshot first (if configured) and, only if the block is not found, it'll ask the connected node for the block. When a range of blocks is requested, the follower will try reading as many blocks as it can from the Mithril snapshot (if configured) and, if any blocks are not contained in the snapshot, it'll ask the connected node for them.

Our development and design teams will adapt to using WebP without significant challenges. Decision \u00b6 We propose to adopt WebP as our standard image format for both web and native applications. This decision is based on several advantages of WebP over JPG and PNG: Superior Compression : WebP provides better compression than JPG and PNG, allowing images to be significantly smaller in size without a noticeable loss in quality. This leads to faster loading times and reduced bandwidth usage, which is particularly beneficial for mobile users. Support for Transparency : Unlike JPG and capable of more efficient transparency handling than PNG, WebP supports transparent backgrounds, which is essential for various design elements. Improved Performance : The smaller file size of WebP directly translates to quicker image loading and rendering, contributing to a smoother user experience. Versatility : WebP is versatile, supporting both lossy and lossless compression, making it suitable for a wide range of image types \u2013 from photographic images to graphical designs.

It incorporates CIP-30 (Wallet DAppBridge) and CIP-95 (Message Signing) specifications. It requires connection to the wallet third party extensions (e.g Eternl) to be able to perform wallet actions.
