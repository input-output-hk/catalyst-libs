Completely optional sections the user may or may not choose to complete.\n2. Sections which may not be present in a draft of a document, but must be present in a \nfinal form of the document.\n\nAs JsonSchema allows `null` or `object` to be valid for optionalSchema, checking if its\nvalid to be `null` in a finalized document must be done as an extra step, \nafter json schema validation.\n\n## Visual Representation\n\nSections represent logical breaks in the form structure.\nOptional Sections allow for the entire section to be toggled off (incomplete).\n\nA Optional Section may have whatever visual representation that is required.\nNominally however, a Optional Section that is in the root of the document\nis known as a ***Optional Document Segment**.\nWhereas a section that is embedded within another section is a \n**Optional Document Section** or **Optional Sub-Section**.\n\nThere is no limit to how many levels sub-sections are nested,\nhowever the application is not required to show them any differently\nfrom one another.\n\nThe visual display of sections has no impact on how it is represented\nin the data captured.\n\nFor Optional Sections, the UI should allow the partial capture and local storage of data\nwithin the section, but NOT submit it if it would be invalid according to the document template schema.\nThe UI may also employ a specific toggle which determines if an Optional Section is included or not.\n\nBefore submitting any document as Final, that contains Optional Sections, the UI must validate that\nthose sections have been properly completed if they are not allowed to be `null` in a finalized document.",
