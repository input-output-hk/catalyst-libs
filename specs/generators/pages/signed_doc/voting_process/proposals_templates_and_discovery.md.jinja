## Abstract

Shows how Proposal documents relate to their Templates, how submission state is determined, 
and how all artifacts are discovered and validated in a decentralized pub/sub network.

## Documents and Roles

* [Proposal](../docs/proposal.md): the authored content.
* [Proposal Form Template](../docs/proposal_form_template.md): defines schema and form hints.
* [Proposal Submission Action](../docs/proposal_submission_action.md): signals `final`, `draft`, or `hide`.
* *Optional [Proposal Comment](../docs/proposal_comment.md)* and 
  *[Proposal Comment Form Template](../docs/proposal_comment_form_template.md)* artifacts exist;
* *Optional [Proposal Moderation Action](../docs/proposal_moderation_action.md)* artifacts exist;

## Relationships

* A Proposal references a Proposal Form Template via [`metadata.template`](../metadata.md#template)
  and a system parameters anchor via [`metadata.parameters`](../metadata.md#parameters).
   * The template’s own [`parameters`](../metadata.md#parameters) must transitively align to the 
     same Brand/Campaign/Category chain. 
* A Proposal Submission Action references the Proposal via `metadata.ref` and repeats `metadata.parameters`, 
  linked to `ref` for consistency.
   * Multiple collaborators may exist; all listed collaborators must submit equivalent `final` 
     actions to be considered final by the deadline.

The Deadline for a Proposal to be Final will be defined in the applicable parameters document(s),
typically the Category Parameters document.

## Versioning and Collaboration

* Proposal [`id`](../metadata.md#id) and [`ver`](../metadata.md#ver) are UUIDv7.
* The first Proposal version must be signed by the original author;
  later versions may be signed by the author or a collaborator from the immediately prior version. 
  See: [Proposal validation](../docs/proposal.md#validation).
* Collaborators are listed in `metadata.collaborators`; 
  actions from collaborators confirm or rescind participation.
  See: [Proposal Submission Action](../docs/proposal_submission_action.md).

## Pub/Sub Discovery Model

All documents are published in the appropriate topic as defined by specs/generators/pages/signed_doc/voting_process/parameters_hierarchy_and_discovery.md.jinja
and their parameters metadata.

To discover the proposal template, a client looks in the appropriate topic for unique document IDs of the proposal template type.
Then they choose the latest version of that template.
This allows a client to determine all the possible proposal templates which are enabled for a given brand, campaign or category.
Client applications then use the templates they discover to allow clients to submit proposal documents which match those templates.
The timing and allowability and other rules are defined by the appropriate prameters document and its parent parameters documents.
Once a proposal is submitted, its automatically draft.
It can be made final by the deadline (as defined by parameters).
If it is, it is a candidate proposal for a contest on the same parameter level.
However, the proposal may be moderated and not be allowed to be a candidate proposal for the contest if a moderation action is submitted against it.
Proposal comments may be attached to a proposal, and they may also be attached to another comment (acting as a reply).
In this case they must link to the same proposal.  You cant reply to a proposal comment on a different proposal.
Comments can also be moderated via moderation actions.  And in which case the client interface should hide them or show them as moderated and redacted.
Comments and proposals can be revoked by their authors.
When a proposal is revoked, all its comments should also be considered revoked, unless it is subsequently re-instated.

At the campaign moderation deadline, the final set of candidate proposals for the contest is determined.
These are then used in the contest voting process, described elsewhere.

### Consumer Pipeline

1. Template intake
    * Verify signature, type, id/ver, `metadata.parameters`, and payload schema validity.
    * Index by `(template-id, ver)` and by anchor.
2. Proposal intake
    * Verify signature, `metadata.template`, `metadata.parameters` (linked to template), 
      and payload against the template schema.
    * Track authorship and collaborators; index by `(proposal-id, ver)` and by anchor.
3. Submission Action intake
    * Verify signature from author or collaborator; verify `metadata.ref` 
      points to the intended proposal and `metadata.parameters` matches (linked_refs to `ref`).
    * For each signer, record latest action: `final`, `draft`, or `hide`.
    * A proposal is “final” iff all listed collaborators (and the author) have a latest 
      `final` action by the configured deadline.

### Status Computation

* Final Set: proposals with all required `final` actions, within configured windows defined by parameters.
* Draft Only: proposals with at least one `draft` and no conflicting `final` from that signer.
* Hidden: honor `hide` semantics (author hides the proposal; collaborator hide = collaborator does not wish to be shown).

## Validation Summary

* Verify `type`, `id`, `ver`, `kid`, `content type`, and (if present) `content-encoding`.
* Verify `metadata.template` exists and aligns via `metadata.parameters` up the same chain.
* Validate the proposal payload against the referenced template JSON Schema.
* For submission actions, enforce signer rules and collaborator unanimity for `final`.
* Apply `revocations` and prefer the highest valid `ver` per `id`.

## Content Addressing and Retrieval

* All documents carry a `document_ref` that includes a CBOR Tag 42 CID locator. 
  See: [Document Reference](../metadata.md#document-reference).
* Pub/sub provides dissemination; the CID enables retrieval from content-addressed 
  storage and ensures immutability.

## Operational Notes

* Timelines and windows come from the applicable parameters (brand/campaign/category/contest); 
  consumers should enforce submission cutoffs as configured.
* Indexes: maintain by proposal, by anchor, and by template to accelerate UI queries.
