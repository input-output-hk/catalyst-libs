## Abstract

Shows how Proposal documents relate to their Templates, how submission state is determined, 
and how all artifacts are discovered and validated in a decentralized pub/sub network.

## Documents and Roles

* [Proposal](../docs/proposal.md): the authored content.
* [Proposal Form Template](../docs/proposal_form_template.md): defines schema and form hints.
* [Proposal Submission Action](../docs/proposal_submission_action.md): signals `final`, `draft`, or `hide`.
* *Optional [Proposal Comment](../docs/proposal_comment.md)* and 
  *[Proposal Comment Form Template](../docs/proposal_comment_form_template.md)* artifacts exist;
* *Optional [Proposal Moderation Action](../docs/proposal_moderation_action.md)* artifacts exist;

## Relationships

* A Proposal references a Proposal Form Template via [`metadata.template`](../metadata.md#template)
  and a system parameters anchor via [`metadata.parameters`](../metadata.md#parameters).
    * The template’s own [`parameters`](../metadata.md#parameters) must transitively align to the 
      same Brand/Campaign/Category chain. 
* A Proposal Submission Action references the Proposal via `metadata.ref` and repeats `metadata.parameters`, 
  linked to [`ref`](../metadata.md#ref) for consistency.
    * Multiple collaborators may exist; all listed collaborators must submit equivalent `final` 
      actions to be considered final by the deadline.

The Deadline for a Proposal to be Final will be defined in the applicable parameters document(s),
typically the Category Parameters document.

## Versioning and Collaboration

* Proposal [`id`](../metadata.md#id) and [`ver`](../metadata.md#ver) are UUIDv7.
* The first Proposal version must be signed by the original author;
  later versions may be signed by the author or a collaborator from the immediately prior version. 
  See: [Proposal validation](../docs/proposal.md#validation).
* Collaborators are listed in `metadata.collaborators`; 
  actions from collaborators confirm or rescind participation.
  See: [Proposal Submission Action](../docs/proposal_submission_action.md).

## Co‑Proposers, Submission, and Moderation

### Co‑Proposers (`metadata.collaborators`)

* Proposals may list *co‑proposers* as [`collaborators`](../metadata.md#collaborators).
  This list grants permission for these accounts to co‑author new proposal versions and participate
  in submission, but does not by itself mean they have accepted.
* A collaborator is considered to have *accepted* collaboration on a given proposal version when
  their latest [Proposal Submission Action](../docs/proposal_submission_action.md) for that proposal
  is `draft` or `final`.
* If a collaborator’s latest submission action is `hide`, they are treated as *not* having agreed
  to collaborate for that proposal.
* The effective collaborator set can change over versions 
  (by editing ['collaborators'](../metadata.md#collaborators));
  the original author can never be removed as an allowed signer for new versions.
  Nor is the original Author listed in the ['collaborators'](../metadata.md#collaborators) metadata.
* The original Author is always and **ONLY** determined by the Author whom signed the first version
  of a proposal where the [`id`](../metadata.md#id) and [`ver`](../metadata.md#ver) are equal.

### Submission Documents (Proposal Submission Actions)

* Submission state is tracked by [Proposal Submission Action](../docs/proposal_submission_action.md)
  documents that:
    * Reference the proposal via [`metadata.ref`](../metadata.md#ref); and
    * Repeat [`metadata.parameters`](../metadata.md#parameters), linked to `ref`.
* The payload is a small JSON object with an `action` field:
    * `final` – signer is submitting this exact proposal version as their final candidate.
    * `draft` – signer confirms collaboration but leaves the proposal in draft.
    * `hide` – signer requests that the proposal be hidden for themselves:
        * For the author: hide the proposal from consideration and UI.
        * For a collaborator: they do not wish to be listed as a collaborator.
        * This means **ONLY** the author can control global visibility of a Proposal.
          collaborators can control if they are listed against it.
* Per signer, only the latest submission action (by time / [`ver`](../metadata.md#ver)) 
  counts for status computation.
* A proposal with collaborators is treated as:
    * **Final** only when the author *and all listed collaborators* have latest `final`
      actions for the same proposal version by the configured deadline.
    * **Draft** when at least one required signer is `draft` (or missing).
    * **Hidden** when a `hide` from the author, or applicable moderation, marks it as not to be
      displayed, even if technically valid.

### Moderation Documents (Proposal Moderation Actions)

* [Proposal Moderation Action](../docs/proposal_moderation_action.md) documents reference a proposal
  via [`metadata.ref`](../metadata.md#ref) and are issued by authorized moderators.
* The exact moderation outcomes (e.g., hide, disqualify, flag for review) are policy‑dependent and
  may evolve; implementations should treat them as an overlay on top of submission status:
    * A moderated‑hidden or disqualified proposal is excluded from candidate sets and UI listings,
      even if all `final` submissions are present.
    * Moderation can apply to proposals and their associated comments; UIs should consistently
      reflect any hide/disqualify decision across all related artifacts.
* Consumers should ensure that candidate selection first filters by valid submission (`final` from
  all required signers) and then applies moderation results to derive the final visible and
  eligible proposal set.

### UI Queries for a Single Proposal

For a given proposal (identified by `proposal.id`/`proposal.ver` and its `metadata.parameters`):

* UIs can retrieve submission actions by querying for
  [Proposal Submission Action](../docs/proposal_submission_action.md) documents where:
    * [`metadata.ref`](../metadata.md#ref) points to the proposal’s [`id`](../metadata.md#id)
      and optionally where required [`ver`](../metadata.md#ver); and
    * [`metadata.parameters`](../metadata.md#parameters) matches the proposal’s parameters anchor.
* UIs can retrieve moderation actions by querying for
  [Proposal Moderation Action](../docs/proposal_moderation_action.md) documents where:
    * [`metadata.ref`](../metadata.md#ref) points to the same proposal; and
    * [`metadata.parameters`](../metadata.md#parameters) matches the same anchor.
* In a pub/sub model, this typically means:
    * Subscribe to the topic derived from the proposal’s parameters.
    * Filter received documents by type and by `metadata.ref` targeting the proposal.
* Locally, an index keyed by `(proposal-id, proposal-ver)` plus signer and document type allows the
  UI to:
    * Compute per‑signer latest submission action (`final`/`draft`/`hide`).
    * Overlay any matching moderation actions.
    * Present a synthesized status for the proposal and each collaborator.

## Pub/Sub Discovery Model

### Overview

* Publication and topic routing are defined by the parameters anchor (brand/campaign/category).
  See: [Parameters Hierarchy and Discovery](parameters_hierarchy_and_discovery.md) for topic
  scope, naming, and subscription strategies.
* Producers publish each document to the topic derived from its `metadata.parameters`.
* Consumers subscribe to the relevant topics for their chosen anchor(s) and filter by document type.

### Discovery Workflow

1. Discover templates
    * Subscribe to the anchor topic(s) and collect all
      [Proposal Form Template](../docs/proposal_form_template.md) documents.
    * For each `template.id`, select the latest `template.ver` (respecting `revocations`).
    * The resulting set enumerates which proposal templates are enabled at the given anchor.
2. Discover proposals
    * Collect or Publish new [Proposal](../docs/proposal.md) documents that reference one of the
      discovered templates via `metadata.template`.
    * Enforce that `metadata.parameters` on the proposal matches the anchor and links to the same 
      parameters chain as the template.
3. Ingest submission actions
    * Collect [Proposal Submission Action](../docs/proposal_submission_action.md) documents by 
      proposal `metadata.ref`.
    * Track the latest action per signer (author or listed collaborator): `final`, `draft`, or `hide`.
    * A proposal is eligible to be “final” only if all required signers have a latest `final` 
      action by the configured deadline.
4. Apply moderation and policy
    * If present, process [Proposal Moderation Action](../docs/proposal_moderation_action.md) 
      artifacts that may hide or disqualify proposals (policy‑dependent).
    * Respect `hide` semantics from submission actions and moderation decisions in UI and candidate 
      selection.
5. Handle revocations
    * Honor [`revocations`](../metadata.md#revocations) on proposals or related artifacts.
      Implementations should treat comments under a revoked proposal as revoked for visibility,
      unless the proposal is re‑instated.
6. Comments
    * [Proposal Comment](../docs/proposal_comment.md) documents attach to a proposal;
      replies attach to another comment.
    * All comments and replies must link to the same proposal; cross‑proposal replies are invalid.
    * Comments may be moderated via [Proposal Moderation Action](../docs/proposal_moderation_action.md) 
      and hidden/redacted accordingly.

### Finalization

* At the configured moderation/finalization deadline (from parameters), compute the final set of
  candidate proposals for the contest at the same anchor level.
* The candidate set consists of proposals that are “final” (per signer unanimity) and not 
  disqualified by moderation.
* These candidates feed into the contest voting process (described in the voting flow documentation).

```

### Consumer Pipeline

1. Template intake
    * Verify signature, type, id/ver, `metadata.parameters`, and payload schema validity.
    * Index by `(template-id, ver)` and by anchor.
2. Proposal intake
    * Verify signature, `metadata.template`, `metadata.parameters` (linked to template), 
      and payload against the template schema.
    * Track authorship and collaborators; index by `(proposal-id, ver)` and by anchor.
3. Submission Action intake
    * Verify signature from author or collaborator; verify `metadata.ref` 
      points to the intended proposal and `metadata.parameters` matches (linked_refs to `ref`).
    * For each signer, record latest action: `final`, `draft`, or `hide`.
    * A proposal is “final” iff all listed collaborators (and the author) have a latest 
      `final` action by the configured deadline.
4. Moderation Action intake (optional)
    * Verify signature and policy scope; verify `metadata.ref` points to the intended proposal and 
      `metadata.parameters` matches.
    * Apply moderation outcomes to proposal visibility and eligibility per policy.

### Status Computation

* Final Set: proposals with all required `final` actions, within configured windows defined by 
  parameters, and not disqualified by moderation.
* Draft Only: proposals with at least one `draft` and no conflicting `final` from that signer.
* Hidden: honor `hide` semantics (author hides the proposal; collaborator hide = collaborator does 
  not wish to be shown), and apply moderation decisions.

## Validation Summary

* Verify `type`, `id`, `ver`, `kid`, `content type`, and (if present) `content-encoding`.
* Verify `metadata.template` exists and aligns via `metadata.parameters` up the same chain.
* Validate the proposal payload against the referenced template JSON Schema.
* For submission actions, enforce signer rules and collaborator unanimity for `final`.
* Apply [`revocations`](../metadata.md#revocations) and prefer the highest valid 
  [`ver`](../metadata.md#ver) per [`id`](../metadata.md#id).

## Content Addressing and Retrieval

* All documents carry a `document_ref` that includes a CBOR Tag 42 CID locator. 
  See: [Document Reference](../metadata.md#document-reference).
* Pub/sub provides dissemination; the CID enables retrieval from content-addressed 
  storage and ensures immutability.

## Operational Notes

* Timelines and windows come from the applicable parameters (brand/campaign/category/contest); 
  consumers should enforce submission cutoffs as configured.
* Indexes: maintain by proposal, by anchor, and by template to accelerate UI queries.
