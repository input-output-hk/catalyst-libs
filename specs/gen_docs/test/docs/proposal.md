# Proposal

## Description

A Proposal is a document which describes a proposed solution or project to
address the criteria of a category within a campaign.

The proposal itself is a draft document, it is not submitted for consideration
unless a `Proposal Submission Action` is submitted which references it.

Proposals themselves are intentionally general, however they may be
linked to a brand/campaign or category via the template used by the proposal.

The payload of a proposal is controlled by its template.
